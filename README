This is a work-in-progress test of separate native compilation of Julia packages.
It is currently Linux-only, but small improvements should let it run on other systems.

# Build the https://github.com/timotaularson/julia/tree/SeparateCompilation branch of Julia.

# From the directory containing this Demo code
# run the julia executable built from the above branch.
# Note that the last step (calling the DemoPkg.test1 function) is expected to fail currently.
julia> include("DemoScript.jl")
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.activate("DemoPkg")
julia> using DemoPkg
julia> DemoPkg.test1(Int64(1))

# Disassemble the resulting shared libraries and compare the native code.
# The demo script compiles correctly:
$ objdump --disassemble test.so > ScriptDisassembly.txt
# The demo package compiles incorrectly, with extra code wrapping the julia_test_* function.
$ objdump --disassemble ~/.julia/compiled/v1.6/DemoPkg/*.so > PkgDisassembly.txt

# I would appreciate any clues toward solving this.
